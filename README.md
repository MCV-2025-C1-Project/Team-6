## Project Structure

This is the project structure, where `WeekX/` folder contains the code developed during that week.  
Inside each week's folder, there is a `README.md` file explaining the scripts.  
Note that the paths to the Development and Test sets for each week can be specified as arguments in the code,  
but by default they are assumed to be located inside the corresponding `WeekX/` folder as `qsdY_wX/` and `qstY_wX/`.
